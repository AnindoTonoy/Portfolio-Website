# Portfolio-Website
A portfolio website is an essential tool to getting more business and building professional brand.
In todayâ€™s digital world, a portfolio is arguably more important than a resume, no matter what industry you work in.
Whether you are a freelance journalist, a recent college grad looking for a job, or even an accountant, when people 
Google your name, your portfolio will provide the most powerful and comprehensive perspective on you.
